## About TAI

TAI is a Tic-Tac-Toe project to understand how [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) works.

## Getting Started

Install [create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app):

```cmd
npm install -g create-elm-app
```

Here are some useful commands:

### `elm-app start`

Run the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

![elm-app-start](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3983879/18608347/157e88ec-7ce7-11e6-8924-a046a95f6381.png)

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console and the browser window.

### `elm-app build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It bundles Elm app and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.

## Future changes

TAI used to have a [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning). I have tried to implement it in a functional way in Elm, but it took way too long to make the moves. In a close future I would like to add this to the project.
